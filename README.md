# Binghamton CS 445 SWE Active Status for Fall 2017. 

## Trackr is a lightweight running application built on Ruby Rails.

### Owners: Ahnaf Raihan, Margie Lehmann, Patrick Watters, Thomas Moshier
### Requester: Rose Williams

### Where we're at
We have completed 4 iterations and half of another as of the end of Binghamton's fall 2017 semester. We have created the baseline app, created the models and databases neccessary, oauth authentication through Facebook with session control, then we implemented the CRUD for connecting weekly mileage goals with the user. Finally, we connected individual users with their own running logs and the CRUD associated with it. 

### How to contribute
Clone this parent directory into a new Cloud9 workspace. Develop, submit any issues, and then commit a pull request. We'll review it and hopefully you'll be a direct contributor to this project!

### Plans for future
Additional features for the running log. Social media integration. Make it a bit prettier!

### To run the server
Clone the repo and run the server with the command with "rails s -p $PORT -b $IP". <br />
Run rspec with "rspec" - TDD. <br />
Run cucumber with "cucumber" - BDD.

### Pitch
Nobody wants obstacles in their way when they go on a run. So why not have an app to match?
Trackr is a running application that goes beyond the basic functionalities of a running log. 
Trackr gives you a simple, easy-to-use interface so there's no more mud on your shoes*. 
We make tracking runs a breeze so you can focus on hitting your goals. 
Speaking of goals, to keep users motivated, Trackr allows users to set goals and track their progress along the way! 
So get up, grab your running shoes, and let Trackr help you hit your stride.

This mud is metaphorical. We cannot guarantee that your shoes will actually be mud free.
