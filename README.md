## Owners: Ahnaf Raihan, Margie Lehmann, Patrick Watters, Thomas Moshier
## Requester: Rose Williams

## Pitch
Nobody wants obstacles in their way when they go on a run. So why not have an app to match?
Trackr is a running application that goes beyond the basic functionalities of a running log. 
Trackr gives you a simple, easy-to-use interface so there's no more mud on your shoes*. 
We make tracking runs a breeze so you can focus on hitting your goals. 
Speaking of goals, to keep users motivated, Trackr allows users to set goals and track their progress along the way! 
So get up, grab your running shoes, and let Trackr help you hit your stride.

* this mud is metaphorical. We cannot guarantee that your shoes will actually be mud free.
